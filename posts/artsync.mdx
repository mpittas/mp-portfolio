ArtSync is a mobile app that was created in Figma and it's designed to streamline the process of buying and selling art online. The app features a minimalist design with lots of white space and consistent aesthetics. The images use placeholder as it allows for better & faster preview.

The app includes user-friendly sign-up and login processes, a home screen that displays the latest products and most popular art pieces across various categories, and a dedicated explore tab tailored to help users discover new artwork that meets their specific preferences. Additional functionalities include a search feature, listing pages, detailed art descriptions, artist profiles, and more.
