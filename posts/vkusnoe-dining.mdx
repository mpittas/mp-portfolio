For this concept design idea I stopped at using beige color for a dining restaurant presentation. We want to show the daily and general menus in a presentable way for the user while keeping the design simple and clean.

The combination of handwritten font with a bold sans-serif font goes well together. The biege background color for the pages allows us to use white background sections.
