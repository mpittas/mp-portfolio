For this dining restaurant's concept design, I chose a beige color scheme to present the daily and general menus elegantly while maintaining a simple and clean layout.

The mix of handwritten fonts with a bold sans-serif font complements each other nicely. The beige background color for the pages also enables the use of white background sections, enhancing readability and visual appeal.
