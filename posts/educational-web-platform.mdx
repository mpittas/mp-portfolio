This project encompasses various stages of design and development, beginning with the initial phase of brainstorming logo concepts. I sketched four different logo options and ultimately selected the fourth for its unique appeal. Following this, I utilized Adobe Illustrator to vectorize the chosen design.

Subsequently, I developed a comprehensive design system, which includes elements such as color schemes, typography, wireframes, and shadows. These components are meticulously detailed in the Figma design file, accessible via the provided link. Additionally, I crafted various components, including icons, form elements, alerts, and navigation tools, which are available in the project file.

With the design system in place, I shifted focus to user experience (UX) development. This phase involved creating two user personas, a user story, a journey map, a user flow, and a moodboard, all of which are detailed further in the linked document.

The final and most enjoyable phase for me was designing the user interface. I drew inspiration from prominent learning platforms such as Udemy, Lynda, Coursera, and Codecademy. Extensive research into similar websites helped identify key user-centric elements to focus on. After thorough planning and creative exploration, I began crafting the design. The final designs are showcased in the linked document, or you can preview the images below.

This project covers different processes

I started by sketching ideas for the logo. I had 4 different options and I chose the 4th one as I liked it the most. Next I opened Adobe Illustrator and started vectorizing.

After the logo was done I started creating the design system. This includes colors, typography, wireframes (containers) and shadows. They are detailed in the Figma design. If you want to view them you can do it [from here](https://www.figma.com/file/wuvM6403Q7Ykd9MdE56CuN/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BC%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=Piu9bNp24aDg6mOA-1). Separetly I created some componet like icons, form elements, alerts and navigations which can be found in the project file.

Once I had the design system I could continue with the UX. I had to create two user personas, user story, user journey map, user flow and a moodboard. See them in detail [from here](https://www.figma.com/file/wuvM6403Q7Ykd9MdE56CuN/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BC%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B0-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5?type=design&node-id=728%3A478&mode=design&t=Piu9bNp24aDg6mOA-1)

<div className="py-6">
  <Image src="/projects/ewp/screenshot-ux.png" width={1000} height={300} />
</div>

Finally I could continue with the most fun part (for me at least) and start designing
the user interface. I took inspiration for other learning platforms like Udemy, Lynda,
Coursera, Codecademy and others. I researched a lot what similar websites offer and
what are the user centric points that I need to focus on. After this I got my hands
dirty and started creafting the design. You can see the final design from this link
or preview the images below
