The "MemoryVault" project is an innovative mobile application designed to create digital time capsules that store users' precious memories. This app allows users to save special moments in the form of photos, videos, audio recordings, and text messages, which can be unlocked on a future date. The memories can also be shared with friends and family, creating a unique and emotional bridge between the past and future.

The app was developed using the Design Thinking process, ensuring a user-focused and iterative approach to design and functionality. The project involved a detailed competitive analysis against similar applications, such as Timehop and Google Photos, and incorporated feedback from user surveys to enhance its features.

"MemoryVault" includes personalized time capsules and social sharing features, ensuring the memories are stored securely and can be revisited and shared easily. The design and development of the app were supported by a strong emphasis on user-friendly interfaces and high security to protect stored data.

The project was thoroughly documented and prototyped using Figma, where the design system—including color schemes and typography—was established to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience.

This app responds to the modern need to securely and conveniently store and revisit personal memories, integrating advanced features like AI-driven content organization and premium subscription options for enhanced functionality.
