"MemoryVault" is an innovative mobile application designed to create digital time capsules that store users precious memories. This app allows to save special moments in the form of photos, videos, audio recordings, and text messages, which can be unlocked on a future date. The memories can also be shared with friends and family, creating a unique and emotional bridge.

The app was developed using the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking" target="_blank">Design Thinking</a> process, ensuring a user-focused and iterative approach to design and functionality. The project describes a detailed competitive analysis against similar applications, such as "Timehop" & "Google Photos", and feedback from user surveys to enhance its features.

"MemoryVault" includes personalized time capsules and social sharing features, ensuring the memories are stored securely and can be revisited and shared easily. The design of the app shows a user-friendly interface and high security measures to protect stored data.

The project is documented and prototyped using Figma, where the design system was established to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience.
