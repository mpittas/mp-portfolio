This project was designed for a music festival called "Thunderstruck," as part of a university assignment. I began by researching existing festival websites to gather inspiration. Armed with ideas, I then shaped the vision for the design in Figma. The chosen font complements the rock/metal theme perfectly, and a dark color palette enhances the overall aesthetic. The website features several key pages, including the homepage, artist profiles, and a page for tickets and venues.

This project was made for a music festival called “Thunderstruck”. It’s an assignment given to my from university. I conducted a research to see what similar website designs. After getting inspiration from few of them I started crafting the vision of the design in Figma.

The font is very suitable for this rock/ metal oriented design and sits very well. I chose dark color palette to match the subject as well. There are different pages - homepage, artist page and tickets and venues page.
