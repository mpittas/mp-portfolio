This project was designed for a music festival called "Thunderstruck," as part of a university assignment. I began by researching existing festival websites to gather inspiration. Armed with ideas, I then shaped the vision for the design in Figma. The chosen font complements the rock/metal theme perfectly, and a dark color palette enhances the overall aesthetic. The website features several key pages, including the homepage, artist profiles, and a page for tickets and venues.
