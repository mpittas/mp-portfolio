This web design is based on Bulgarian font calligraphy. I was assigned with the task to craft modern and minimalistic design that provides the user with options to test different fonts, read about the history of Bulgarian calligraphy. I had to use no icons and mainly work with typography.

The final result is very consistent and the sections have lots of space between them so different hi elements can breathe.

Also I tested different color schemes to provide more customized options and different version for the client to choose from.
