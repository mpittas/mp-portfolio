This web design is inspired by Bulgarian calligraphy. I was tasked with creating a simple and modern design that lets users try out different fonts and learn about the history of Bulgarian calligraphy. The design focuses on typography and avoids using icons.

The final look is clean and spacious, giving each part of the page room to stand out.

I also tried out different color schemes to give the client several options to choose from.
