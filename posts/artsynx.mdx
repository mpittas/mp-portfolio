ArtSync is a mobile app design I created in Figma that allows the user to sign up and sell or buy art online. It uses simplified design approach woth white space and consistency. I was very please with the final result.

It includes sign up/log in process, home screen to view the latest and most popular art and different categories. There is a dedicated explore tab to find new art filtered to match your needs. There’s also Search, Listing page, Detail page, Artist page and more.
