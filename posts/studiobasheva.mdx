A well-known architect in its community in Bulgaria and U.K. reached out and requested a more simple approach for redesigning the old website.

First, we started with creating the design for the pages so we can define the design system, such as colors, typography, components and layout. We decided on using only bright tones to give a feel of warmth and welcoming and to represent the studio as best as possible.

Once we were happy with the design we proceeded with the development. WordPress was the platform we chose as it gives the client the flexibility to easily update the content of the website without writing any code.

The website is has SEO optimisation for search engines as Google and it loads faster due to speed and security configurations.
