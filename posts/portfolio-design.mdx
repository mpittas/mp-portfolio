This is a web design for my website that has a clean and minimalist design, with a focus on showcasing my work. It include a simple color scheme, clear typography, and the use of images and videos to highlight projects. The layout is usually easy to navigate, with a prominent menu and clear calls-to-action for viewing specific projects.
