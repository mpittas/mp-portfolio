Move Camp is a platform concept for helping people move their homes. It offers a wide range of services that will cover all clientâ€™s needs.

For the styling I chose a more simple solution by using pastel colors and conveying a feel of warmth and coziness. A lot of spacing has been added between the sections so the information is easily readable.

For the development of the website it will rely on adding smooth animations on scroll and thus adding more interactivity and making the website feel more live.
