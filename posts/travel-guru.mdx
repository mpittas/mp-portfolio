This is project I did for a university assignment. The goal was to create a landing page showcasing a specific product. I stopped on the idea of presenting a travel based mobile application.

For the theming I chose to work with darker backgrounds and light colors for the front elements. I stuck with this elegant and modern design as it was going well with the subject of the project.
