BonsaiFarm is an online e-commerce website that sells Bonsais trees. I developed the homepage as I was testing different color combinations. I loke how different elements overlap with each other and it creates a feeling for depth of field.

The website features a bold typography using "display" category font to make the website feel more alive and unique. The color combination is very subtle while using different shades of brown and green to represent the subject of flowers.

Images are carefully handpicked to present the brand and the products in the best way possible. You can take a look at the Adobe XD design from the button below.
