A law firm approached me to develop their new website based on a design provided in a Figma file by the talented graphic designer <a href="https://futurenature.net/" target="_blank">Georgi Tsvetkov</a>. The website features several pages with abstract shapes and animations to make it more interactive, which improves the user experience. You can view the project here:

<div>
  <Button
    href="https://zipit.legal/"
    title="View project"
    className="mt-4 mb-12"
  />
</div>
