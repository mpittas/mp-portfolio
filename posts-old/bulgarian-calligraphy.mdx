I was tasked with creating a simple and modern design that lets users try out different fonts and learn about the history of Bulgarian calligraphy. I also had to incorporate a visually appealing timeline that tracks the progress of the history. The design focuses on typography and it avoids using icons for less distraction while browsing.

The final look is clean and spacious, giving each part of the page room to stand out. I also tried out different color schemes to give the client several options to choose from.
